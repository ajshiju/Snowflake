11. What are Data Shares in Snowflake?
Data sharing is the feature provided by snowflake to share data across snowflake accounts and people outside of the snowflake accounts. 
You can share data according to the customized datasets shared. For people outside snowflake, 
you need to create a reader account with access to only read the data.

Below are the objects that can be shared:
Tables
External tables
Secure views
Secure materialized views
Secure UDFs

There are two types of users:
1. Data provider: The provider creates a share of a database in their account and grants access to specific objects in the database.
The provider can also share data from multiple databases, as long as these databases belong to the same account.
2. Data consumer: On the consumer side, a read-only database is created from the share. 
Access to this database is configurable using the same, standard role-based access control that Snowflake provides for all objects in the system.
