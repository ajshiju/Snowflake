SEMI STRUCTRED DATA TYPE:

1.ARRAY
Contain 0 or more elements of data.Each element can be diff data type and  
is accessed by its position in the array.

Create table my_array_table(
name varchar ,
	hobbies array
);

Insert into my_array_table
select 'Alina nowak', ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('WRITINH,'STAMPCOLLLECTIO');
									  
									  
2. OBJECT - COLLECTION OF KEY_VALUE PAIRS.
									  
									  
Create table my_objet_table(
name varchar ,
	Address object
);
 Insert into my_objet_table
select 'Alina nowak', OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('10708 SQUAW VALLEY ,'23060');
				
				
				
3.VARIANT
Universal semi-structred data type  used to  represnt arbitray data structure


This is why you might see it referred to as a universal semi-structured data type in the documentation.

That is primarily used for storing whole semi-structured data files.
you could load an entire JSON or POC document into a variant column or split its elements

up into separate rows during loading.									  
					
					
Create table my_varr_table(
name varraint ,
	address varraint,
	hobbies variant)
);
		
		
		insert into my_varr_table
		select 'alina' :: Varinat 
		obejst_construct('pstcode','23060','firstlinbe'),
		Arreay_consturc('writing','painting','baking');
		
		
		One important bit of information to know is that a variant data type can hold up to 60 megabytes of

compressed data per row.

So if you're loading a large file into a variant column that exceeds that threshold, an error will

be thrown.

You will either have to split that JSON file prior to loading it or use a file format option to separate

the JSON objects in a file so they're loaded as separate rows.
