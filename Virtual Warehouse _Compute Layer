Scale up and down : Spin up and shut down unlimited number of warehouse without resource contention
it uses :
DML
DQL
COPY INTO- data loading

User only interact with named warehouse – not compute resources
VW configurations changes on fly
VW contain local SS storage used to store raw data
VW created via snowflake UI or SQL commands


VW can be created or destroyed instantly

DROP WAREHOUSE MY_WAREHOUSE

Create warehouse MY_MED_WH
  Warehouse_size=‘MEDIUM’;

ALTER WAREHOUSE My_WH SUSPEND :

When it suspend it does not cost anything .

Resize : Alter warehouse my_wh_2 set warehouse_size=Medium ;

Dynamically Scale

Create warehouse my_wh_3
Min_cluster_count=1
Max_cluster_count=3
Scaling_policy=Standard;


3 states
Started- active and ready to process queries  –consume  credits
Suspend-shutdown – no credits
Reszie- up or down – process in progress

By default when its created its in started state.
Suspending a VW – removes all computes nodes from warehouse

ALTER WAREHOUSE MY_WH SUSPEND

ALTER WAREHOUSE MY_WH RESUME – putting back into started and can execute queries


Pros – avoid painfull compute rsources

Example : if you know work only 9-5 hours – users could suspend and avoid being billed overnight

3 parameters  that controls the suspend and resume behaviour in an automated way

AUTO SUSPEND

Create warehouse my_wh 
Auto_suspend=300;




You are not guarnetedd a shutdown in less than 60 sec.

Setting zero or null means – vw will never suspend

by default set t 600 sec whne creating ie 10 min

Caveats(limitation)
VW cache is cleard when an instance is stopped
So queries could take longer when resumed.




Auto resume
Create waehosue my_wh
Auto_resume=true;  - default is on – control manually if required.


INTIALLY SUSPEND
Create warehouse my_wh
Intially_suspend=true;
Warehouser crtate intailly in susped mode – default is starerd state
This help you not to immiedylay start billing – when you want to create some tables – which doesn not require virtual warehouse

Size – extra small to 6 times extra large

Five x and six x – only available in snowflake aws – it will take longer time to provisions

Auto suspend – no if inacativiyty before warehoure suspends 

Pros and cons – if we autosuspend-  it wil take more credit
If not cash will clear – and qureiy will take more time – which results in more credits



How to decide the size of warehouse?

IF ITS SMALL QUIRES USE – SMALL SAIZE
IIF COMPLEX AND CONATIONS MORE PREDICATES ,MORE PROJESCTINNBS – USE LARGE

SNOWFLAKE RECOMMEDS RUN SOME  TYPLICAL QURIES– TEST
FOR DATA LAODING – SMALL IS SUFFEICNT
SNOWFLAKE RECOMMEDNS SMALL  

AS THE COMPUTE POWERS DOUBESLW  WITH ACH SHORT SIZE IT DOWUBES THE COST


VIRTAUAL WARE HOSUES ARE BILLED WHNE THERY AE STARTED STATED – NOT BASED ON HOW MANY QUIRES BEINGE XECUTES ON THEM.

THE FIRST 60 SECINDS ARE ALWSYS CHARGD FIRST THEN PER SECOND BASINS



Scaling Up

2 ways
For query perfoamne

Alter warehouse my_wh
Set warehoisue size=‘laergr

Scaling up  is not an automated process. - need user inreactoins
Scaling  up also performs using UI

Reszing Vw doest need query to stop running

Extras comute resource fron large Vw ar only used for qued and new quries

Opposite – decres size of our running warehosur rmves computer resource from  warehisue – when resource are removwe – cahse  will be dropped and incarese perfomeance of the query

Scaling OUT

Named poold of vw that are automaicatlyt add or rewmove indivaidaul warehisure dyanamcially in response to the nuber of concurrent users or quires



Auto resume
intail suspsend 


Blue - running and no issues
Yellow- queue 



Only Pay when the clustering is running : 
Charge every 60 seconds



Multi Cluster 

MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT
MAX)CLUSTER_COUNT
Setting thses values same will put the multi cluster warehisue in Maximized mode


All vw in entrepresi editions are configures as multi cluster
When setting two parmatesr diffenertlty – you put multi cluster called auto scale mode


When in auto scale mode – the user can set a property called sacalling policy when creating multi cluster wartehisue
Aim is to minismise queing by more aggresvy scaling out vwq

CRETE WAREHOSUE MY
Min_clsuet_count=1
Ma_clsur=4
Scaling_polyc=satandar


Cluster start with minimum – ahen a query is qued additiobnal clusrer will be added.,

Sclinag down –check will be oerfomed every 1 minut to  determine if the load on the leased busy vw could be redisturbed to other vw with suffcubent spare capacity


ALTER WAREHOUSE mywh SET SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY';
ALTER WAREHOUSE mywh SET SCALING_POLICY = 'Standard';


Standard (default)

Prevents/minimizes queuing by favoring starting additional clusters over conserving credits.

The first cluster starts immediately when either a query is queued or the system detects that there’s 
one more query than the currently-running clusters can execute.

Warehouse Starts… :Each successive cluster waits to start 20 seconds after the prior one has started.
For example, if your warehouse is configured with 10 max clusters, it can take a full 200+ seconds to start all 10 clusters.

Warehouse Shutdown: :After 2 to 3 consecutive successful checks (performed at 1 minute intervals), 
which determine whether the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed to the other clusters without spinning up the cluster again.

Economy

Conserves credits by favoring keeping running clusters fully-loaded rather than starting additional clusters,
which may result in queries being queued and taking longer to complete.

Warehouse Starts… :Only if the system estimates there’s enough query load to keep the cluster busy for at least 6 minutes.

Warehouse Shutdown:… After 5 to 6 consecutive successful checks (performed at 1 minute intervals), which determine whether
the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed 
to the other clusters without spinning up the cluster again.
