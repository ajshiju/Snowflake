10. How does zero-copy cloning work and what are its advantage
Zero copy cloning is just like a creating clone of the snowflake object.
You can create clones of SF objects such as DB, schema, table, stream, stage, file formats, sequence, and task.

when you create a clone, Snowflake will point the metadata of the source object to cloned object depicting cloning until you make any changes to cloned object.
1. Main advantage of this is it creates a copy of the object in less time.
2. It does not consume any extra space if no updates happen on the cloned object.
3. fast way to take backup of any object.

Syntax:
create table orders_clone clone orders;
