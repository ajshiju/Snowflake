COPY INTO LOCATION / @stage
 Internal stage ,external stage or any external location.
 
 COPY INTO @MY_STAGE FROM TABLE;
 
 Also copy o/p of the query.
 
 
 The file format you can copy into a stage are a bit more limited than those supported 
 by the copy into table command.
 
Copying to location supports the limited files, so file formats 
like CSV and TSV, as well as the semi-structured
file formats, JSON and parquet

If you've copied a file to an internal stage, we can use the get command to retrieve it.
This specifies a source stage and a target directory on a local file system.


GET @my_stage  file://folder/files/;



By default, results are loaded to a stage.Using the copying to location command are split into multiple files.
The exact number of files generated is impacted by the size of the virtual warehouse executing the copy
into command.


By default,the generated files are in CSV file format compressed using GZIP and are always encoded using UTF eight.

All data files unloaded to a snowflake internal location are automatically encrypted using 128 bit keys.


exmaple 1
use of a select query to copy data into a named stage.

The files generated from executing this command can be prefixed with a string by including at the end

copy into @my_stage/result/data_
from (select & from t1)
file_format=my_csv_file_format;


exmaple 2:

copy into @%t1
from partition by ('date='||to_varchar(dt))
file_format=my_csv_file_format


exampel 3:

The copy into location.

Command can also copy table contents directly to an external cloud providers blob storage such as an

S3 bucket without the use of a stage object.


copy inton 's3://mybucket/unlaod/'
from
storgae_integration=my_int
file_format=my_csv_file_format;


Copying to location includes a copy option called partition by this partitions unloaded data into a

Increasing the number of threads can improve performance when downloading large files.
