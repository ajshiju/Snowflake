Where is metadata stored in Snowflake?
Once the table is created in Snowflake, 
it generates metadata bout the table containing a count of the rows, 
the date-time stamp on which it gets created, and aggregate functions such as sum, min,
and a max of numerical columns.
Metadata is stored in S3 where snowflake manages the data storage.
that's why while querying the metadata, there is no need of running a warehouse.
